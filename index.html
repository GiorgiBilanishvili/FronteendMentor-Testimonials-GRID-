        "I was an EMT for many years before i joined the bootcamp. I've been
        looking to make a trastition and have heard some people who had an
        amazing expariance here. I signed up for the free into cource and found
        it incredible fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was
        the best - and most qrualling - time of my life. Since completing the
        cource, I've successfuly switched careers, working as a Software
        Engineer at a VR startup."

        "before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I
        needed some structure from proffesional who can help me learn
        programming step by step. I was encouriged to enroll by a former student
        of theirs who can only say wonderfull things about the program. The
        entire curiculum and stuff did not dissapont.They where very habds-on
        and I never had to wait long for assistans. The agile team project, in
        partucular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a
        way that no tutorial could even had. In fact, I've often referred to it
        during intervievs as an example of my developer experience. It certenly
        helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receving multiple
        offers. 100% recommended!"
